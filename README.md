```bash
This project is an Android-game, the Purpose of the game is to eat as many vegetarian food as you can without eating meat.
This game was made by me as a joke for my girlfriend (she is the girl that eats) so I didn't do alot of documentation, also 
I made this app before I started the degree with knowledge I gained from online courses.
